# Welcome to Econ 128 - Data Science 

We will distribute labs and examples via github, this way you can easily download the examples. We encourage you to maintain your own github account for the course labs and homework assignments.

All the assignments for this class will use Python. The class examples and tutorials will use, for the most part, the browser-based IPython notebook. The IPython notebook  (also called Jupyter Notebook) allows code execution along with rich text, and thus makes examples easier to follow. 

First, you should setup your programming assignment and download the required Data Science tools. Follow the this tutorial to download and configure a Docker image :

There are many online tutorials to introduce you to scientific python programming. Here is one that is very nice: https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures  (chapters 1 - 4).
