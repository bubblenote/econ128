## Homework # 1

All the assignments for this class will use Python. The class examples and tutorials will use, for the most part, the browser-based IPython notebook. The IPython notebook  (also called Jupyter Notebook) allows code execution along with rich text, and thus makes examples easier to follow. While we have strived to make the programming component of this course straightforward, we will not devote much time to teaching programming. Basically, you should feel comfortable with:

1. How to look up Python syntax on Google and StackOverflow.
2. Basic programming concepts like functions, loops, arrays, dictionaries, strings, and if statements.
3. How to learn new libraries by reading documentation.
4. Pose questions to Professors and Peers (on Sakai) or on StackOverflow

There are many online tutorials to introduce you to scientific python programming. Here is one that is very nice: https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures  (chapters 1 - 4).

This homework has several parts to help you learn the basic usage of Python libraries. We ask that you walkthrough parts A - C, and then complete and submit part D through SAKAI. 


1. [Part A]() 
2. [Part B]()
3. [Part C](HW1\ Part\ C\ Exploratory\ Data\ Analysis.ipynb)
