## Lab # 3


This lab will introduce the Sklean library which is a great tool for data mining and data analysis. In the next two labs, we will discuss two types of supervised machine learning problems, called classification and regression. 

In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities. Classification is sometimes separated into binary classification, which is the special case of distinguishing between exactly two classes, and multi class classification, which is classification between more than two classes.  

For regression tasks, the goal is to predict  a continuous number, or a floating-point number in programming terms. Predicting a person's annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task. When predicting income, the predicted value is an amount, and can be any number in a given range. Another example of regression task is predicting the yield of a corn farm given attributes such as previous yields, weather, and number of employees working on the farm, etc. This task of predicting a continuous variable can be modeled as a Linear Regression problem. 

Linear regression, or ordinary least squares (OLS), is the simplest and most calssic linear method for regression. Linear regression finds the parameters w and b that minimize the mean squared error between predictions and the true regression targets, y, on the training set. The mean square error is the sum of the squared differences between the predictions and the true values. 

Take a look at an example in the following tutorial:
