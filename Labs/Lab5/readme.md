## Lab # 5


This lab will introduce the Sklean library which is a great tool for data mining and data analysis. In the this lab, we will discuss a supervised machine learning problem, called classification. 

In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities. Classification is sometimes separated into binary classification, which is the special case of distinguishing between exactly two classes, and multi class classification, which is classification between more than two classes.  


Take a look at an example in the following tutorial:
